//                                      (Express Framework)


// Express Framework is a third party module not a built-in module,
// so you have to install it in the project folder before using it,



// To install Express Framework,
// 1- Open cmd on the project folder path
// 2- Initialize the package.json file in the project folder using the following command:
//      npm init
// 3- Install Express Framework using the following command:
//      npm install express --save



/* Hint: If you already have package.json file in your project folder,
    open it and see the dependencies, if you find it express,
    then don't install Express Framework with the previous command, just use npm install instead */



/* What is a package.json file ?
    package.json It's a file that keeps the installs you made in the project and their versions, 
    so it's easy for you to install them again, let's say 
    you delete the external modules folder(node_modules) to make the project folder size smaller
    when you upload it to Github for example, then you want to reinstall the external modules,
    instead of installing each module On its own, just type in the cmd: npm install
    and npm will read the package.json file and see previous installations and versions and reinstall it. */
